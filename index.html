        The name <span class="rijec">Lego</span> is an abbreviation of the two Danish words "LEg GOdt", meaning "play well." It is a
        mantra that the Danish company has followed for more than 80 years. The <span class="rijec">Lego</span> brick in its current
        form was introduced in 1958. The privately-held company is owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, who is
        the third richest man in Denmark and the grandson of the company's founder. <span class="rijec">Lego</span> sales by 8% in
        2017 as the company worked to clean up inventories in established markets of North America and
        Europe. One bright spot was China where revenue jumped double-digits. <span class="rijec">Lego</span> signed a partnership
        with Chinese internet giant Tencent and has plans to further expand its presence in this strategic
        market. Lego plans to open an office in Dubai at the end of the year to support efforts to expand
